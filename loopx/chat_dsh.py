"""The steward channel's managed-host transport: one bounded segment per turn.

The managed host runs one bounded DeepSeek Harness work segment per request and
does not promise an interactive or cross-turn host session, so this adapter does
not pretend to hold one. Every Chat turn starts one segment on the resolved
managed execution profile, hands it the channel's bounded history plus the
current message, and returns the final assistant message as the answer.

What this transport deliberately does **not** claim, because a caller must not
infer it:

* no partial streaming: the answer arrives as one final message;
* no cross-turn host session: the visible history is Chat-side context, and each
  segment is a fresh one;
* no tool authority: the segment is pinned read-only (see
  ``STEWARD_SEGMENT_ENV``), so a model that reaches for a tool is refused by the
  dsh sandbox itself, and the answer must come from the evidence LoopX supplies.

The managed host cannot cancel a segment once it has started, so this adapter
holds **one** executor slot per binding: a segment start while the previous
segment is still running is refused with a typed error instead of quietly
starting a second executor, and an interrupted segment's answer is discarded
rather than folded back into the channel's visible history.
