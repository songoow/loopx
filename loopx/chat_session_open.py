"""Open a Chat session on the channel that owns its executor and model.

A Chat entry point (the Codex App / dashboard Chat server, a CLI surface, or a
future transport) translates a request into a session; it does not decide which
executor runs the conversation. Each channel resolves that itself through its
own owner, so an entry point can never disagree with the readback the same
channel publishes:

* the steward channel resolves through :func:`chat_manager.open_manager_session`
  -- its explicit configuration, else its shipped default -- and its transcript
  is one conversation across whatever executor it currently resolves;
* a Goal-scoped channel runs on ``DEFAULT_GOAL_AGENT_ID`` when the caller makes
  no explicit pick.

An explicit pick is the caller's own choice and always travels.
